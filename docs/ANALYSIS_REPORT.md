##  BUSINESS KPI ANALYSIS

### 1. TPV by Entity (PF vs PJ)

| Entity | TPV | % of Total | Transactions | Avg Ticket |
|--------|-----|------------|--------------|------------|
| **PJ** | R$ 13.47B | 69.3% | 123.6M | R$ 108.95 |

**Key Insight:** PJ entities have 5.4x more transactions than PF but **PF has 2.4x higher average ticket**. This suggests PF handles larger individual transactions despite lower volume.

**Strategic Implication:** PF segment is high-value, low-volume. Focus on retention and upselling.

##  TRANSACTIONAL INSIGHTS

### 5. Installments Analysis

**Top 5 Installment Options by TPV:**

| Installments | TPV | % of Total | Avg Ticket |
|--------------|-----|------------|------------|
| **1x** | R$ 8.72B | 44.9% | R$ 64.70 |
| **10x** | R$ 2.21B | 11.4% | R$ 2,243.26 |
| **12x** | R$ 1.62B | 8.3% | R$ 2,852.93 |
| **3x** | R$ 1.58B | 8.1% | R$ 592.08 |
| **2x** | R$ 1.35B | 6.9% | R$ 337.31 |

**Critical Findings:**
1. **Single installment dominates** (44.9% of TPV) but has lowest avg ticket (R$ 64.70)
2. **Long-term installments (10x, 12x) have massive avg tickets** (R$ 2,243 and R$ 2,852)
3. **Installment length correlates with ticket size** - clear pattern of higher value for longer terms

**Strategic Recommendations:**
1. **Promote 10x and 12x installments** - High-value transactions with significant revenue potential
2. **Test intermediate options (4x-9x)** - Gap in adoption between 3x and 10x
3. **Educate merchants on installment benefits** - May increase conversion on high-ticket items
4. **PJ-specific installment strategy** - Encourage longer payment terms for business purchases

**Revenue Opportunity:** If we could shift just 5% of 1x transactions to 10x installments, TPV could increase by R$ 435M (assuming avg ticket increase)

### 6. Price Tier Analysis

| Price Tier | TPV | % of Total | Avg Ticket | Transactions | Merchants |
|------------|-----|------------|------------|--------------|-----------|
| **NORMAL** | R$ 15.25B | 78.4% | R$ 130.72 | 116.6M | 42.9M |
| **AGGRESSIVE** | R$ 1.97B | 10.1% | R$ 114.96 | 17.1M | 2.9M |

| **DOMINATION** | R$ 1.00B | 5.2% | R$ 235.51 | 4.3M | 572.8K |

**Key Insights:**
1. **Normal tier dominates** (78.4% TPV) - standard pricing serves most merchants
2. **Domination tier has highest avg ticket** (R$ 235.51) despite smallest volume
3. **Intermediary tier underperforming** - Only 6.3% of TPV, potentially priced incorrectly
4. **Aggressive tier** has lower avg ticket (R$ 114.96) than Normal tier - pricing strategy working to attract high-volume, lower-value merchants

**Strategic Recommendations:**
1. **Review Intermediary tier pricing** - Sitting between Normal and Domination, but not capturing significant market share
2. **Upsell Normal tier merchants** - Largest segment, small % moving to higher tiers = significant revenue
3. **Domination tier growth opportunity** - Highest avg ticket, focus on premium merchant acquisition
4. **A/B test pricing adjustments** - Particularly for Intermediary tier
